# seasonpackarr

A companion app for autobrr that will automatically hardlink any files that match a pushed season pack.\
At the moment the port and the directories are hardcoded, but I plan on making them configurable.


Huge credit goes to [upgraderr](https://github.com/KyleSanderson/upgraderr) and specifically [@KyleSanderson](https://github.com/KyleSanderson), whose project provided great functions\
that I could make use of.
